# CryptoTools
Because of new kind of cryptographic viruses, I wanted to learn what is cryptography / cryptanalysis: How it works, what mathematical theory are behind it and finally how is it implemented.

Then I decided to write in Python (because I also wanted to learn the trio numpy / scipy / matlibplot) a library made with my own implementation of the real methods.

CryptoTools is not dedicated to break every passwords but to learn most of the aspects of cryptology.

# Content of the lib
The library will contain the main functions / objects to work with but also a lot of script tests to try these algorithms. Finally, I also tried to optimize some of them but this seems to be more than a drop in the ocean of calculations :)

Enjoy to use it.
